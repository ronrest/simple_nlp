Intro
------
A package with wrapper functions for the nltk package. The aim is to make the
functionality of the already great nltk package even more convenient.

With natural language processing, you will often be making use of nested lists.
So rather than having to make use of lots of nested for loops in your own
functions, these nested lists are automatically taken into account. The depth of
the nesting is automatically calculated and the appropriate nltk functions are
called on the relevant items.

Installing
----------
This package is still in hte early stages of development. But if you wish to try 
it out, then run the following code in a terminal window:
